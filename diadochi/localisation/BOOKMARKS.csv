DARK_AGES;Rise of Macedonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DARK_AGES_INFO;In 359 BC, the kingdom of Macedon was in turmoil. The Illyrians under Bardylis had conquered much of Macedon, and an expedition led by Perdiccas III to retake the land resulted in his death. He was succeeded by his infant son Amyntas IV but, recognising the perils of such a young king, Perdiccas' younger brother Philip declared himself king shortly after. Other than the Illyrians to the north and west, Philip's immediate problems were the powerful Thracians to his east and the many Greek city-states to the south, the most powerful of which was Athens. Will Philip preserve Macedon's independence, or will he be responsible for its downfall?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIKING_ERA;Death of a Colossus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIKING_ERA_INFO;On the tenth of June 323 BC Alexander the Great died from a fever. Shortly after his death his generals made a compromise about who was to succeed him. Philippos Arrhidaios was to become king and if Alexander's unborn child was male, he too would become king. Furthermore, many of Alexander's generals would become governors and Perdikkas would become regent. Will the Kings somehow protect their rule against the ambition of the generals, or will the empire that Alexander created fall due to internal struggle?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EARLY_MED;Demise of the Argeads;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EARLY_MED_INFO;In order to secure his rule, the regent Cassander ordered the deaths of Alexander IV and and his mother Roxane in 310 BC. Subsequently, the Argead empire collapsed and in the following years the Diadochi would proclaim themselves kings over their respective domains. They would each claim that they were the rightful heirs to Alexander's empire. Amidst the backdrop of the intrigue and bickering of the Diadochi, tribes of Gauls were migrating into the Balkans and subduing the native tribes there. They would soon become a grave threat to the Hellenistic world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HIGH_MED;Fall of Antigonus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HIGH_MED_INFO;After the Antigonid defeat during the Babylonian war, they had to give up the eastern satrapies. While Seleucus was consolidating his new gains and fighting the Indians, Antigonus attacked the other Diadochi once again. Cyprus was taken from Ptolemy and most of southern Greece was taken by his son, Demetrius Poliorcetes. Antigonus was still much more powerful than the others which is why the other Diadochi formed a coalition against him. The decisive battle would come at Ipsus in Anatolia. The armies of Seleucus, Cassander and Lysimachus stood against that of Antigonus. Antigonus was killed in the battle, but Demetrius managed to escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LATE_MED;End of the Diadochi Wars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LATE_MED_INFO;In 284 BC Lysimachus, who at this point ruled most of Thrace, Macedonia and Anatolia, had some problems at court. His new wife Arsinoe II, daughter of Ptolemy I, managed to convince Lysimachus to kill his heir Agathocles. The surviving relatives of Agathocles fled to Seleucus' court and solicited his aid. These people were also accompanied by Ptolemy Keraunos, an exiled son of Ptolemy I. Seleucus found an opportunity to expand his realm and invaded Lysimachus' lands. Lysimachus was killed and defeated by Seleucus at the battle of Corupedium in 281 BC. This victory was short-lived: Seleucus was killed while crossing into Europe by Ptolemy Keraunos, who seized Macedonia. With the death of the last of the Diadochi came an end to the wars which had dominated the Middle-East for the last four decades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_803;Philip II of Macedonia was the father of the better known Alexander the Great, but deserves equal recognition. He spent much of his childhood as a hostage in Thebes and this is rumored to have influenced him in his reforms. These reforms gave birth to the Phalangite, whom would dominate Greek warfare for three hundred years to come. Philip II's reign would transform Macedonia from a weak state, barely able to withstand the raids from it's tribal neighbours, to a superpower controlling most of the Greek city-states and Thrace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_140003;Bardyllis was an Illyrian who, apparently from low birth, became king by uniting the Dardanian tribes. He would soon prove to be a menace to the northern Greek states. In Macedonia, he put puppet-kings on the throne and made them pay tribute. He killed many Molossians during his invasion of Epirus and he conquered Upper Macedonia when one of his puppets revolted. However, Bardyllis would be defeated and killed by Philip II and the Dardanians lost most of their conquests as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_40114;Kotys was king of the mighty Odrysian kingdom in Thrace. The kingdom was created by Teres I, who succesfully exploited the power vacuum after the departure of the Persians after their disastrous Greek expedition. The Odrysians were able to raise huge armies, although offensives often didn't materialize because of logistical reasons. After Kotys' death, the kingdom would be split between his three sons, which allow Macedonia to conquer Thrace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_90311;Artaxerxes II was the ruler of the mighty Persian empire for forty-six years. The beginning of his reign saw Egypt successfully revolt and an attempt by his younger brother Cyrus, who had the support of ten thousand Greek mercenaries, to seize the throne. He later had to defend Asia Minor from a Spartan invasion. Artaxerxes failed to retake Egyp in his lifetime, but he did foil a joint Egyptian-Spartan invasion of Phoenicia. A large-scale revolt of his satraps was also crushed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_801;Upon Alexander the Great's death, his imbecile brother Philippos Arrhidaios was eventually proclaimed as king, though his appointed regent would actually rule. He soon fell under the sway of his strong-willed wife Eurydice, who spent most of her effort in freeing Philip from the influence of his regents. Eventually Philip and his wife were captured by Olympias, mother of Alexander, who executed them both because they were a threat to the young Alexander IV.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_401;Antigonus Monopthalmus was a Macedonian general who served first under Philip II, and then under his son Alexander the Great. He received Phrygia at the Partition of Babylon and soon entered a rivalry with both the regent Perdiccas, and Eumenes, the satrap of Cappadocia. Antigonus prosecuted against Eumenes which would result in his conquest of almost all the territory within the empire; Eumenes was executed. The other Diadochi united against Antigonus and after a decade or so of almost continuous war, Antigonus was defeated and killed at the Battle of Ipsus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_601;Ptolemy was a Macedonian general and childhood friend of Alexander the Great. At the Partition of Babylon he was granted the satrapy of Egypt. Ptolemy initially fought against Perdiccas, and then joined the coalition against Antigonus, specifically aiding Seleucus to retake his satrapy of Babylon. Following the death of Antigonus, Ptolemy began a centuries-long rival with Seleucus and his descendants over the eastern Mediterranean. Ptolemy died at the age of eighty-four.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_30001;Lysimachus was a Greek general and bodyguard of Alexander the Great. He served with distinction in India and thus was awarded with the satrapy of Thrace at the Partition of Babylon. He later joined the eventually victorious campaign against Antigonus, receiving land in Asia Minor as a result. Lysimachus later conquered Macedonia with the aid of Pyrrhus of Epirus, but relations between the two soon soured and the latter was driven from Macedonia. Intrigue at Lysimachus' court led to an invasion by Seleucus, who defeated and killed the former.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1101;Peithon was a Macedonian general and bodyguard of Alexander the Great. He was given the satrapy of Media at the Partition of Babylon, though only part of it as it was deemed to powerful for one man. It was with Peithon's involvement that the regent Perdiccas was betrayed and murdered. Following the death of the new regent Antipater, Peithon began to make war on his neighbouring satraps which prompted them to form a coalition against him. He was only able to extricate himself from the situation with the help of Antigonus, who later tricked and killed Peithon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1;Antipater was a Macedonian general with a successful resume from the reign of Philip II. During Alexander the Greats campaigns he stayed behind in Macedonia to provide Alexander with reinforcements and rule Macedonia in his stead. After the death of Alexander he stayed in command of Macedonia and quickly took a anti-Perdiccan stance. After Perdiccas' death, he was named regent over the kings. However, Antipater was by now already in his seventies and quickly died. He named as his successor not his son, Cassander, but Polyperchon, laying the foundations for future conflict in doing so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1001;Seleucus was one of the strongest of the Diadochi and one of few to establish a dynasty. Seleucus was born in Northern Macedonia around the same time as Alexander the Great. Seleucus accompanied Alexander into Asia and rose to command the elite Hypastist unit. After Alexander's death, Seleucus became Perdiccas' right hand and commander of the Companion cavalry. When Perdiccas died, Seleucus was awarded the satrapy of Babylonia, but was driven from it 5 years later. He fled to Ptolemy, in Egypt, and served as his commander for the next 4 years. After an Antigonid defeat, Seleucus managed to re-establish himself in Babylon and managed to conquer the eastern satrapies. He would go on to defeat Antigonus and Lysimachus and set a trend in founding cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_2;The regent, Antipater, would have 6 sons. The most popular of them was Cassander. Cassander was taught along with Alexander the Great, although he is rumored to have poisoned Alexander. When Antipater died, he chose Polyperchon in stead of Cassander as his successor. Cassander promptly invaded with an Antigonid army and reconquered Macedonia, although he wasn't very stable here. He had trouble with Antigonid invasions and Epirote interference from Olympias, Alexander's mother. Cassander would assassinate all of Alexander's relative in time. Cassander participated in the coalition against Antigonus, but didn't make any gains from its success. He would die 4 years after and his dynasty would lose the throne to Antigonus' son, Demetrius, 3 years later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_402;Demetrius was the son of Antigonus, one of the most powerful of the Diadochi. He was given an army to defend Syria from Ptolemy in 312 BC, but was defeated in the battle of Gaza. He was next sent to attack Seleucus in Babylonia, but was defeated doing so. However, following that defeat, he would get many victories. He conquered Athens from Cassander and Cyprus from Ptolemy. He next unsuccessfully besieged Rhodes, gaining the nickname Besieger. In 302 BC, he returned to Greece again and captured many cities. Antigonus and Demetrius were defeated in the battle of Ipsus the next year and they lost most of their Asian holdings. Demetrius quickly recovered by conquering Macedonia from Cassanders infighting descendants. He grew too ambitious however and was defeated by Seleucus and would die in the latters prison;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_ALEXANDER_RISES_DESC;During the celebration of the marriage between Alexander I of Epirus and Cleopatra in 336 BC, the latter's father, Philip II of Macedon, was assassinated by his bodyguard Pausanias. Some suggest that the assassination was in retaliation for Philip's refusal to punish Pausanias' rapist, Attalus, who was a prominent general at the time. Others suggest that the assassination occurred at the behest of Philip's wife Olympias. Regardless of who was ultimately responsible, Philip's twenty year old son Alexander succeeded to the throne. At this time, Macedonia dominated the southern Balkans and Philip had been preparing for an invasion of the mighty Persian Empire. Will Alexander realise his father's dream?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_END_OF_AN_ERA;End of An Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_END_OF_AN_ERA_DESC;After four years of war, Alexander had all but completed his conquest of the Persian Empire in 330 BC. Darius III had fled and was murdered by his heir Bessus, who crowned himself Artaxerxes V though his authority only extended across the easternmost satrapies of the empire. This provided Alexander with the legitimate cause of avenging Darius' death and the excuse that he was bringing peace to the empire now in turmoil. Will Alexander continue east and discover even greater glory? Whatever happens, it is certain that it is the end of an era and the dawn of a new one in the Mediterranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_THE_RESTORATION_OF_SELEUCUS_DESC;The satrapy of Babylonia was given to Seleucus at the Partition of Triparadisus in 321 BC. However in 316 BC, he was forced to flee by Antigonus who was returning from his campaign against Eumenes. Seleucus sought refuge in Egypt and served as a general for Ptolemy. They defeated Antigonus' son Demetrius Poliorcetes at Gaza in 312 BC and killed the Antigonid satrap of Babylonia there. Ptolemy subsequently gave Seleucus 1000 troops to retake his satrapy. The following Babylonian war would be one of the turning points of the Diadochi wars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_604;Ptolemaios Keraunos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_604;The years since the death of Alexandros have not been kind to the Makedonian homeland. Although initially enjoying stability under the Antipatrids, in the last 15 years four kings have successfully contested the throne. The last king, Lysimachos, had been defeated in battle by Seleukos just months before. Seleukos was treacherously assassinated by Ptolemaios Keraunos who quickly seized the throne. The worst is yet to come as barbarian tribes to the north are poised to take advantage of the unstable kingdom. Will Keraunos be the next in a succession of temporary rulers or will he beat his historical outcome and rise to match the greatness of his brethren is Aigyptos?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_602;Ptolemaios Soter was a major participant in the Diadochi wars. His diversion of Alexandros’ body towards Aigyptos was one of the leading causes of the collapse of the Makedonian empire. He broke convention by not appoint his first-born son as heir. Instead he was succeeded by his youngest son, Ptolemaios Philadelphos. Now having ruled for one year, he has inherited a strongly centralized state with an efficient administration. Aigyptos has the strongest navy of the eastern Mediterranean sea and controls several Greek islands. Ptolemaios’ greatest threats are the Seleukid dynasty to the north and his brother Keraunos currently ruling in Makedonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In the 40 years since then Seleukos managed to conquer most of Alexander’s empire. In this year, he has defeated Lysimachos and taken Anatolia. As he was crossing into Europe, he was assassinated by Ptolemaios Keraunos. As Seleukos draws his last breath, his son Antiochos rushes to the west to claim his father’s empire. Antiochos’ first order of business should be the consolidation of Anatolia: many of the Anatolian dynasts are eager to secede and form their own destiny during an uneasy succession. Further to the south, Ptolemaic Egypt is closely monitoring Seleucid activity in preparation of contesting Coele-Syria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_408;Antigonos Gonatas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_408;Antigonos Monopthalmos was the most powerful of Alexander's successors. He boasted a large army, controlled a sizeable treasure and held huge tracts of land in the richest parts of the former Persian empire. Little more than two decades have passed since then and his grandchild, also named Antigonos, inherited little more than a disperate collection of cities inside of Hellas. Many failed expeditions to regain past glories have left Antigonos with a tenuous hold on his realm and the democracies, tyrannies and garrisoned cities yearn to regain their former independence. Opportunities are presenting themselves, however. Barbarian tribes have slowly but steadily moved into the area north of Makedonia. Will Antigonos use this distraction to claim the Makedonian throne and restore the great Antigonid legacy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
